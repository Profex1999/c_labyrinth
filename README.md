# c_labyrinth
Small labyrinth project. The main goal is to use a recursive algorithm to find the way out. You can find the maze structure in the file named "griglia.txt". The maze size is 20x20 and will only work with these dimensions. You are free to edit the code and make it work with different sizes.
